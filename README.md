# perpetual
node script to run things... perpetually. adapted from legacyshell

## usage

as per tradition for my projects, simple installation!

1. `npm i`

then run once to create config

- `npm run start`

then customise it in `store/config.yaml`, making a new entry for every thing

then run like this:

- `node .\perpetual.js --default`

## it doesnt work?

i dont care. i use this for my own stuff. i know that it works on linux and thats all i need.
